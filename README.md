# Market Segmentation Analysis

This repository contains Python code for performing market segmentation analysis using KMeans clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM). The dataset used for analysis is from McDonald's and includes various attributes related to customer preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset (`mcdonalds.csv`) contains information on customer preferences, such as gender, usage of specific products, and Likert scale ratings.

# Dataset Overview
- **Columns:**
  - Display the columns in the dataset.
- **Shape:**
  - Display the dimensions (rows and columns) of the dataset.
- **First 3 Rows:**
  - Display the first 3 rows of the dataset.
# Data Preprocessing
- **Binary Conversion:**
  - Convert categorical columns to binary (0/1) for analysis.
- **Column Means:**
  - Display the rounded means of specific columns.

# Dimensionality Reduction
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.
# Clustering
# KMeans Clustering
 **KMeans:**
  - Apply KMeans clustering with 4 clusters.
 **Visualization:**
  - Visualize the clustering results using a scatter plot.

# Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
- **GMM:**
  - Apply Gaussian Mixture Models with 4 components.

# Describing Segments
**Segment Descriptions:**
  - Utilize the clustering results to describe different segments.

# Visualization
**Mosaic Plots:**
  - Generate mosaic plots to visualize relationships between segments, Likert ratings, and gender.
